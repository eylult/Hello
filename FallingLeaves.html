                        <p>Yes, they do. The leaves fall, at a certain time, certain month of the year. A month which I wasn't born in, luckily.</p>
						<p>There is a connection though. I feel it in my bones; coming, coming, coming... I have never waited for it with an excitement, I don't think I ever will. Then one asks; "<i>Why are so pale close to the end, like the falling leaves?</i>" </p>
						<p></br>Why would I open the maze of thoughts in my mind to you? You would get lost, and I wouldn't bother to help.. If you are insisting though, ask away <a href="mailto:eylultasyurek@yahoo.com?Subject=Sternen Wanderer" target="_top">
