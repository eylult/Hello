					<p>MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS! Yeah, got that Steve Ballmer feeling? Good, good. Now let's talk about one of my favorite things, maps. </p>	
					<p>A map is never too complicated, such thing is not possible. I agree, there are simple maps around (and I don't like them). But it is absolutely contemptuous to say that a map is "too complicated". Some people just don't talk the language of the maps, and my heart goes out for them... </p>

<td>The Map Of Brugges</td>
<td>Ah, I still save all the maps that I got from Brugges! I love tracking down the streets that I walked on that long, cold Belgium night after I got lost and couldn't get back to my hotel until 6 in the morning.</td>

<td>The Map of Middle Earth</td>
